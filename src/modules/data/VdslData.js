            text: `VDSL, or Very High bit rate Digital Subscriber Line, stands at the forefront of broadband technology, delivering high-speed Internet over "short distance" copper phone lines with speeds reaching an impressive 50 Mbps. The technology is revolutionizing connectivity by strategically installing network equipment near your neighborhood's phone cabinet and connecting it back to the Central Office via Fiber Optic Cables. This innovative approach significantly shortens the copper part of the phone line to distances ranging between 100 and 400 meters, enabling your VDSL modem to achieve unprecedented speeds.`,
